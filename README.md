# SCT_CS_2
A small educational tool that performs basic image "encryption" by manipulating pixel values. The project demonstrates simple reversible transformations (pixel swapping, arithmetic operations, XOR, and permutation) to obfuscate image contents for learning and experimentation. Not suitable for real security or production use.
